# Recipe-Book

Recipe Book: Recipe Book is a full-stack MEN (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) application that allows users to explore, create, edit, and delete recipes. Inspired by the love of cooking, Recipe Book offers an API-centric approach with a focus on backend development, making it a robust tool for users who want to maintain a digital collection of their favorite recipes. Users can read, create, update, delete, and manage favorite recipes within the app. Users can view a comprehensive list of recipes or get detailed information about a single recipe. The app Allows the addition of new recipes to the database with complete details. Existing recipes can be completely or partially updated to refine the cooking instructions or ingredients. Users can also remove recipes from their collection. Finally, Users can add recipes to or remove them from their favorites list.

Technologies Used: The Recipe Book application leverages a MEN stack, combining MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js to create a dynamic and responsive backend. MongoDB serves as the noSQL database, offering flexibility and scalability for recipe data storage, while Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, is utilized for structured data interaction and schema validation. Express.js is employed as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests and middleware integration, offering a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Node.js provides the runtime environment, enabling server-side scripting and the execution of JavaScript code outside a web browser. For the minimal frontend representation, basic HTML and CSS are used to render simple views, primarily for interaction with the API, ensuring that the focus remains on backend functionality. The combined use of these technologies facilitates the creation of a user-friendly platform where users can manage their recipes with ease.

Getting Started: 

Access the app by cloning the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Kick-off the setup by installing the necessary Node.js dependencies which pave the way for your application's functionality. Make sure MongoDB is active, as it's the backbone for storing all your delectable recipes. Fire up the server using Node.js and the app is ready to handle requests for adding, editing, and savoring recipes. For a seamless experience, interact with the API endpoints through the front-end interface or a REST client like Postman.

Attributions: Recipe-Book was developed by Aris Spenos with the following resources: 

MongoDB - Used as the database for storing data.
Mongoose - Used for modeling MongoDB data in Node.js.
Node.js - Used as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Express.js - Used for building the RESTful API endpoints.

Next Steps: 

Moving forward, the development of the Recipe Book app will include the integration with a third-party API to access a broader range of recipes and ingredients. Additional functionalities planned are user profile customization options to accommodate dietary restrictions, and the introduction of social interaction features such as recipe sharing and user feedback mechanisms. Improvements to the user interface and user experience are also on the agenda to enhance overall usability.
